Would soon add about:

1. **Importance of the ability to think clearly and how we can easily lose it**  
2. **How much Peter Thiel is correct in saying, "We live in a world in which courage is in less supply than genius"**  
3. **Importance of taking risks at a young age**  
4. **How bioengineering is not just a technological field but a paradigm shift that blends biology and engineering to solve humanity's biggest challenges**
